# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**

This dataset contains data about age of employees using the Bankmarketing file


**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

The best performing model as shown at the top of the table gives a more accurate reading and data based on the metrics analysis.


## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

Optimize the hyperparameter using HyperDrive, created a trained logistic regression model then run AutoML. Uploaded train.py then create a  tabular dataset in the Notebook.  lastly the results are compared to see which parameter gives the best model


**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

Parameter chosen gives a much accurate metrics going by the final outcome and with the graph.


**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

Choosing early stopping policy helped to run the experiment quicker and much faster

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

The difference is very slight in metric. The reason for the difference is each parameters runs differently based on it’s architecture


## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

In future working using other parameters different from the one specified in this current project will be to run the model to see if it will give a better and more accurate outcome
